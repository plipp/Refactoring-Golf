Refactoring Golf
================
Provides Java Sources for the game 'Refactoring Golf'

The rules
---------
Compare the directories with the code of the single golf holes and try to do the refactorings required to get 
from one hole to the next: E.g. compare<br>
```  
  0. Initial Tee/src/main/java/refactoringgolf/store
  <-->
  1. First Hole/src/main/java/refactoringgolf/store
```  
and start refactoring.

For each refactoring the following (minus-)scores have to be summed up:
**TODO**

The team with the minimum (minus-)score wins at the end.
